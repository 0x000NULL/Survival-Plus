![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musay1aNFQ3NnBLVkU](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musay1aNFQ3NnBLVkU)

Fear not, a new bunch of new items are added within this plugin.
![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musYlc2YzFQQWwwUkE](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musYlc2YzFQQWwwUkE)

## **Understand the usage of tools**
![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7muscG9TOTRrRmZnMFk](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7muscG9TOTRrRmZnMFk)

* Punching wood? Nope. You must use an **Axe** for breaking any **wooden **blocks.
* Digging dirt with your bare hands? Nope. You must use a **Spade **for breaking any **sandy **blocks.
* Breaking stone? You must use a **Pickaxe** for breaking any **hard **blocks.
* Gathering fruits or vegetables? You must use a **Hoe **for **harvesting **crops.
* Placing artificial blocks? You must use a **Hammer **for **placing**.
* Cut strings or disarm TnT? You must use a **Shears **for **cutting**.

## **Survive and thrive**
First, find some trees. Gather some **sticks** by breaking the **leaves**.

* Leaves have **25%** chance to **drop 1 stick**, otherwise no drop.

Sticks are also obtainable from **Saplings**.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musZWRIV3BPOUVUdnM](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musZWRIV3BPOUVUdnM)

Next, find some **gravels**. Gather some **flints** by breaking them.

* Gravel has **50%** chance to **drop 1 flint**, otherwise no drop, by breaking with **bare hands**.

Gravel is usually found near **lakes, rivers, extreme hills, caves, and cliffs**.

Hmm, if you can't find any gravel in your area, try the following method if it's available:

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musaEZMckVoX2xleDQ](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musaEZMckVoX2xleDQ)

Now you can make a **Hatchet** with these two items.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musMGFwOHZlU0tQSjQ](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musMGFwOHZlU0tQSjQ)

Break down some logs with your Hatchet, convert some logs into planks and sticks.

Now you can make a **Mattock**.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musYzVUYjVZdEU0Ylk](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musYzVUYjVZdEU0Ylk)

Next, find some **stones**. No, you can't break dirt straight down to find stones yet, you will need a **shovel**.

Hence, find a cave, or a mountain. Gather stones, and if you're lucky, get some **coal **too.

To make a workbench, you need the last tool, **Hammer**.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musWnlUcmhGZnd6VjA](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musWnlUcmhGZnd6VjA)

It is used to make **workbenches **and **build artificial blocks**.(See below)

## **Get a weapon**
You can choose either using a Stone Sword or **Shiv** as your basic weapon.

**Shiv** adds poison effect on hit, but with less damage.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musUk8taHMxZU82cVU](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musUk8taHMxZU82cVU)

Harvest **cows **and **sheep **to obtain **Leather **and **String**(from Wool)
**
Hydration**
If you are thirsty, craft a **Bowl** to obtain water.
Simply throw **1 Bowl** into a water source, it will become a **Water Bowl**.
![https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qP_RLIYx_kAHQphgijBpM7dXHrHpPhnM](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qP_RLIYx_kAHQphgijBpM7dXHrHpPhnM)

Drinking it will quench the thirst, but **purified water **is recommended when cauldrons are affordable. (See section *Food & Water > Thirst*).

**## Plan and craft**
Then, you craft a **Workbench** like so:

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musdkJOOEhpQ2lGR0k](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musdkJOOEhpQ2lGR0k)

With your workbench, you can upgrade your tools to stone tools.

With a shovel, digging Gravel is less risky to get a flint.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musSjE0cVQ3Z25uYXc](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musSjE0cVQ3Z25uYXc)

## **We need to go deeper**
Need to discover the underground? You'll need **Torches**.

But you need to make a **Firestriker** for igniting.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musd2labkZOZEJPZWs](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musd2labkZOZEJPZWs)

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=1xwc4U78qX-qz_eZ-TkUyDTAaJjmswxpQ](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=1xwc4U78qX-qz_eZ-TkUyDTAaJjmswxpQ)

Firestriker can also be used like **flint and steel**, **cook** some meat, **smelt** some simple items.

It has a **durability of 8**. Right-click on the ground to set it on fire.

To use the **smelting option** of a firestriker, right click while sneaking.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musZlFnMDB3eFg0Sk0](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musZlFnMDB3eFg0Sk0)

**Controls:**

1. Put unsmelted/uncooked items in the smelting slot.
1. Click on the result slot to smelt/cook one item.
1. To exit, either click on the Firestriker or press Escape.

**Firestriker Recipes:**

* Any cookable **Food**

* **Charcoal**

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musWFBwLW1iaC1HMWM](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musWFBwLW1iaC1HMWM)

* **Glass**

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musMmczNU1Ybk5MYnM](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musMmczNU1Ybk5MYnM)

* **Brick**

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musNTR1ZmNiX0lQb2s](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musNTR1ZmNiX0lQb2s)

To make a **Furnace**, further works are required.

Start gathering some **Clay** by breaking clay blocks, or:

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=16dGGRI7DI3SuUHD3VvxWsd_KWXafzyIf](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=16dGGRI7DI3SuUHD3VvxWsd_KWXafzyIf)

Turn clay balls into **Brick** with Firestriker, it's an essential material for making furnaces.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musNTR1ZmNiX0lQb2s](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musNTR1ZmNiX0lQb2s)

Make your own **Furnace** in the workbench.

![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musVkdXMHZkLWRTTTQ](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musVkdXMHZkLWRTTTQ)

Now you can smelt ores with Furnace.

## **Settle down before sunset**
Time to settle, make sure you bring the workbench with you, it's important.

Make some **Chests **to store your items.
![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musMmNxNlQ3ZkY2ZHM](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musMmNxNlQ3ZkY2ZHM)

**Build your house**
This is where hammer comes in handy.
All **artificially crafted blocks** (eg. planks) can only be **placed** when with the use of a **hammer**.
![https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musc05ReDBGZnZlNUk](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B8D0KMKK7musc05ReDBGZnZlNUk)
Put a **hammer **on the **off hand**, your **blocks **on the **main hand**, start building your house!

Each **placed block** has **10% chance** to reduce hammer's **durability **by **1**.
